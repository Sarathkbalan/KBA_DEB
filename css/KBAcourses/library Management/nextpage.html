           To create an Indian environment with fresh air to breathe, clean water to drink, nutritious food with no one left hungry, and a way to care for everyone’s health should be the priority for you and me.—Ratan Tata

Ratan Tata (1937–2024) was one of the most influential and inspirational personalities of our times—an iconic business leader who was instrumental in transforming independent India’s industrial landscape.

Established in 1868, the Tata Group spans a gamut of industries, from salt to steel to software, and is synonymous with quality and trust.

        In this ground-breaking book,
        Clears reveals exactly how these minuscule changes can grow into such life-altering outcomes. 
        He uncovers a handful of simple life hacks (the forgotten art of Habit Stacking, the unexpected power of the Two Minute Rule, 
        or the trick to entering the Goldilocks Zone), and delves into cutting-edge psychology and neuroscience to explain why they matter.
         Along the way, he tells inspiring stories of Olympic gold medalists, leading CEOs, and distinguished scientists who have used the science of tiny habits to stay productive, motivated, and happy.

            Are you also tired of putting off your dreams until "tomorrow?" Guess what! Tomorrow never comes. Am I right?
I've procrastinated and putt off my desire to write a book for a decade. I always came up with excuses like, "it's not the right time." Or, "I need to do more research."
But in 2015 I got tired of this endless procrastination, and finally took action. Six months later, my first book was published.
